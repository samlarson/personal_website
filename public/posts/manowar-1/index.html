<p>Kubernetes has maintained a position in the spotlight of cloud infrastructure ever since Google donated it to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a> in 2015. In a search to strengthen the robustness of my personal Kubernetes clusters I experiment on, I looked for an open-source suite of chaos engineering tools. <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/">Gremlin</a> is a firm founded by some of the engineers at Netflix who originally coined the term &lsquo;chaos engineering&rsquo;, and their product certainly has the most complete set of features, but in terms of open-source projects there were four major options to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/linki/chaoskube">Chaos Kube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/asobti/kube-monkey">Kube Monkey</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/target/pod-reaper">Pod Reaper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/powerfulseal">Powerful Seal</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested, take a look at my notes I collected when I looked through each of their repositories. The bottom line was that none of them were particularly well-suited for bare-metal Kubernetes implementations with the amount of flexibility I wanted, so I began to work on my own project. Once I finish adding documentation to the codebase I will add the code to GitHub and write up a tutorial on use-cases here.</p>

					::: OVERVIEW :::

[Chaos Engineering] - intentionally injecting attacks or otherwise breaking components of a distributed system to improve
		      fault-tolerance and redundancy

[Kubernetes Objectives] -
~ Identify threats, bugs, flaws in our Kubernetes infrastructure
	~ Aggregate alerts collected by Prometheus Operator
	~ Read through other corporate outage reports and Kubernetes/cloud post-mortems
	~ Utilize a Chaos Monkey inspired tool to uncover new weaknesses

~ Measure the impact of each system weakness
	~ How significant is failure in clusters?
	~ How available is Kubernetes? How durable on average?
	~ How do internet-facing applications introduce new weaknesses?

~ Neutralize weaknesses in categorical order:

        --------|--------
        |       |       |
Known   |  [1]  |  [2]  |
        |       |       |
        --------|--------
        |       |       |
Unknown |  [3]  |  [4]  |
        |       |       |
        --------|--------

         Known    Unknown

	~ [1] Known Knowns - something we are aware of and understand
		~ {1.a.} High CPU Usage / CPU Throttling
		~ {1.b.} Version Upgrade Issues
		~ {1.c.} OS Kernel Incompatibilities
		~ {1.d} Rebooted master node (alert fired)

	~ [2] Known Unknowns - something we are aware of but don't understand
		~ {2.a.} CPU Usage Variability
		~ {2.b.} 100% of kube-proxy Targets Down
		~ {2.c.} Random Pod Restarts

	~ [3] Unknown Knowns - something we understand but aren't aware of
		~ {3.a.} Total Time to Restart Clusters
		~ {3.b.} Total Time to Rollback Kernel on All Clusters
		~ {3.c.} Performance with Random Pod Termination

	~ [4] Unknown Unknowns - something we don't understand and aren't aware of
		~ {4.a} Behavior with 100% Network Saturation
		~ {4.b} Behavior with Complete Cluster Shutdown
		~ {4.c} Behavior with High CPU Saturation



					::: TOOLS :::

  [Chaos Kube]
~ Periodic and arbitrary termination of pods in a cluster
~ Link: https://github.com/linki/chaoskube

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [ 		Advantages		|		Disadvantages		 ]
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | * Easy installation with Helm       | * Pod termination is random by        |
  |                                     |   default which prevents fine-tuned   |
  | * Time-related arguments in chart,  |   without custom helmcharts           |
  |   probably the simplest to setup    |                                       |
  |                                     |                                       |
  | * Filtering via label, annotation,  |                                       |
  |   namespace, minimum age in CLI     |                                       |
  |                                     |                                       |

  | * Kill options are fine-grain, e.g. |                                       |
  |   kill all, fixed #, % range        |                                       |
  |                                     |                                       |
  | * Each opted-in attribute specified |                                       |
  |   in .yaml as metadata labels	|					|
  | 					|					|

  |					|					|
  | * Parameters for iterative/auto	|					|
  |   modes are fine-grain		|					|
  | 					|					|
  | * Log collector via stdout or	|					|
  |   Prometheus			|					|
  |					|					|
  | * Web UI for logs and configs	|					|
  |					|					|
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	~ Additional Notes:
		~ {Interactive Mode}: manually inject attacks (operates on nodes, pods, deployments, namespaces)
		~ {Autonomous Mode}: reads policy file that contains pod/node scenarios, each scenario lists matches/filters/actions, executed on loop in cluster
		~ {Label Mode}: specify which pods to kill with a few options (seal/ label in pods); imperative alternative to autonomous mode
		~ {Demo Mode}: point at a cluster and a Heapster server and let it attempt to figure out what to kill based on resource usage



					::: KEY TAKEAWAYS :::

~ For a Proof of Concept, either PowerfulSeal or KubeMonkey should be used in an experimental environment
~ If project value increases over time, it would be worth considering a license for Gremlin's professional suite
~ It should be fairly straightforward to implement a chaos scheduler in existing Kubernetes clusters
~ PowerfulSeal has modes, which would be very useful for prototyping (start in manual, write autonomous after testing)
~ KubeMonkey has fine-grain options for pod termination, and can be run as a k8s app or helm chart (if I need hyper-specific conditions to terminate)
